Rachit
This week, I put in a lot of work to boost our sponsorship efforts. I spent about four hours building a detailed list of 500+ potential sponsors in Excel, then another two hours organizing it so it’s clear and easy to use. I also dedicated around three hours to helping design an 11-page sponsorship package, making sure it’s both eye-catching and informative. Altogether, it was a solid mix of research, organization, and creative work to set us up for stronger outreach.
